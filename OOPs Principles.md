### 4 Principles of OOPs:
#### 1. Polymorphism.<br>2. Inheritance.<br>3. Abstraction.<br>4. Encapsulation.
### Polymorphism :
#### Polymorphism has combination of 2 words "poly" and "morphism" poly means many and morphism means many forms. The ability of displaying message in many forms is called polymorphism.
#### In Java mainly polymorphism divided into 2 types :
##### 1. Compile-time polymorphism.<br>2. Runtime Polymorphism.
#### Compile-time polymorhism.<br>It is known as static polymorphism and it can be acheived by method overloading or operator overloading.
**Note :** **operator overloading cannot be supported by java**
#### Runtime polymorphism.<br>It is known dynamic method dispatch and it can be acheived by method overriding.
#### Rules in method overloading :<br>1. All method which are to be overloaded shoud be in the same class<br>2. Method name should be same but the signature of the method and numbers of parameters of method should be different.<br>3. Return can be different or same.
#### Rules in method overriding : <br>1. All overriding methods should have same definition like return type, number of parametrs.<br>2. Inheritance is must in method overriding<br>3. Private methods cannot be overrided.
### Inheritance :
#### - It is a mechanism that a child object acquires all the properties of its parent object.<br>- Inheritance can be acheived in java by using __extends__ keyword.<br>- super keyword is used to use the methods and variables of parent class in child class.<br>- super() method using to invoke the parent class constructor in child class. 
#### In Java mainly polymorphism divided into 2 types :
##### 1. Single-Level Inheritance.<br>2. Multi-Level Inheritance.<br>3. Hierarchial Inheritance.<br>4. Hybrid Inheritance<br> 5. Multiple Inheritance.
